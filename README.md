# Advanced-Control-Systems
Assignments for the course of Advanced Control Systems at UNIVR.

### Robot model
The first part of the project computes a symbolic robot dynamic model for the provided  ```.urdf```. In the folders ```Energy```, ```LagrangianDynamicModel``` and ```NewtonEulerDynamicModel``` there are all the steps to compute the model. In order to compare the results with the ones from the Robotics System Toolbox from MATLAB everything has been computed numerically. Everything is explained in the report.

### Control architectures
In the folder ```simulink``` there are all the schema applied to the computed dynamic model. In particular we focus on **motion** and **force** control. Each subfolder has its own parameters and model architecture.  All the achieved results are shown in the report.
